            and to write unit tests for functionality built using Reactive Extensions constructs.

            management in Reactive Extensions. Those types are used extensively within the implementation of Reactive Extensions and are useful when writing custom query operators or
            schedulers.

            The <b>System.Reactive.Subjects</b> namespace contains interfaces and classes to represent subjects, which are objects implementing both IObservable&lt;T&gt; and IObserver&lt;T&gt;.
            Subjects are often used as sources of events, allowing one party to raise events and allowing another party to write queries over the event stream. Because of their ability to
            have multiple registered observers, subjects are also used as a facility to provide multicast behavior for event streams in queries.

            Connects the observable wrapper to its source. All subscribed observers will receive values from the underlying observable sequence as long as the connection is established.

            <returns>Disposable used to disconnect the observable wrapper from its source, causing subscribed observer to stop receiving values from the underlying observable sequence.</returns>
